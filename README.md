# Digantara SRE Assessment

## üöÄ Objective

The goal of this project is to set up a self-hosted **Gitea** instance for Git repository management and **Grafana** for monitoring and visualization, with **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration via **Authelia**. All services are routed through a reverse proxy (**Nginx**) for secure access and authentication.

### Components:

- **User**: Accesses services over the internet.
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Handles incoming traffic and routes it to internal services.
- **Authelia**: Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for Gitea and Grafana.
- **Gitea**: A self-hosted Git service for source code management.
- **Grafana**: Visualization and monitoring platform.
- **Prometheus**: Collects and aggregates metrics.
- **Log Flow**: Gitea and Authelia logs are to be sent to Prometheus for future aggregation.
- **Grafana**: Uses Prometheus data for dashboards and monitoring.
